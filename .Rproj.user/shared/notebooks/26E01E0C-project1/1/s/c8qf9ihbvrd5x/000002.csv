tlmgr using installation: /Users/ChristineHuang/Library/TinyTeX
TeX Live (https://tug.org/texlive) version 2020
"
"2","Detected an existing tlmgr at /Users/ChristineHuang/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/tlmgr. It seems TeX Live has been installed (check tinytex::tinytex_root()). You are recommended to uninstall it, although TinyTeX should work well alongside another LaTeX distribution if a LaTeX document is compiled through tinytex::latexmk()."
"2","The directory /usr/local/bin is not writable. I recommend that you make it writable. See https://github.com/yihui/tinytex/issues/24 for more info.
