When it comes to data science, there has been a debate between Python and R languages that I have recently learned about. Both Python and R are generally useful and helpful for coding. However, each has their own advantages and disadvantages. 

Python generally has a more simplified syntax (ex. has less braces and parentheses) and is more popularly used among people. On the other hand, R offers more easily accessible packages and is used more often by those specifically in the field of biostats. 

As I practice and learn more about both languages, I hope to add more to this list.




#go to add-ins. insert image. put browse. see if it works on the viewer.make sure to save it. It should work

```{python}
#this is a python code chunk
print("Austin, we're going to get through this!")
```

```{R}
library(reticulate) #install package reticulate
#this is an R code chunk 
py$x
y<-2
```

```{python}
r.y+1==3
```

it can't be this exact example but it might work
do I need to put an image here in blog post?
pros and cons and advantages and disadvantages of r and python
talk about what python is 
talk about basics
talk about tools that are used 
give an example
put code there as well 
maybe put a link to a different website with more information
