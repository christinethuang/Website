<p>When it comes to data science, there has been a debate between Python and R languages that I have recently learned about. Both Python and R are generally useful and helpful for coding. However, each has their own advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Although there are many more advantages and disadvantages between Python and R, listed below are the characteristics that I personally noticed.</p>
<p>Python:
- has a more simplified syntax (ex. has less braces and parentheses)
- is more popularly used among people</p>
<p>R:
- is used more often and specifically in biostats and for biology majors
- offers more easily accessible packages</p>
<p>As I practice and learn more about both languages, I hope to add more to this list.</p>
<p>Below is</p>
<p>#go to add-ins. insert image. put browse. see if it works on the viewer.make sure to save it. It should work</p>
<pre class="python"><code>#this is a python code chunk
print(&quot;hello world!&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## hello world!</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>x=&quot;dog&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate) #install package reticulate
#this is an R code chunk 
py$x</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;dog&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>y&lt;-2</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>r.y+1==3</code></pre>
<pre><code>## True</code></pre>
<p>it canâ€™t be this exact example but it might work
do I need to put an image here in blog post?
pros and cons and advantages and disadvantages of r and python
talk about what python is
talk about basics
talk about tools that are used
give an example
put code there as well
maybe put a link to a different website with more information</p>
