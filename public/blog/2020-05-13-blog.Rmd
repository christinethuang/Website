#go to add-ins. insert image. put browse. see if it works on the viewer.make sure to save it. It should work

```{python}
#this is a python code chunk
print("hello world!")
x="dog"
```

```{R}
library(reticulate) #install package reticulate
#this is an R code chunk 
py$x
y<-2
```

```{python}
r.y+1==3
```
