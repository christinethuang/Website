When it comes to data science, there has been a debate between Python and R languages that I have recently learned about. Both Python and R are generally useful and helpful for coding. However, each has their own advantages and disadvantages.

For instance, Python generally has a more simplified syntax (ex. has less braces and parentheses) and is more popularly used among people. On the other hand, R offers more easily accessible packages and is used more often by those specifically in the field of biostats. 

Below are some examples. The first example is one of the most basic expressions in Python. I decided to print out "Austin, we're going to get through this!" I saw this message written in chalk on the sidewalk of South Congress and wanted to express support towards the community during the COVID-19 pandemic.  

```{python}
#this is a very basic python code chunk
print("Austin, we're going to get through this!")
```

The second example is 
```{R}
library(reticulate) #install package reticulate
#this is an R code chunk 
y<-2
```

```{python}
r.y+1==3
```

it can't be this exact example but it might work
do I need to put an image here in blog post?
pros and cons and advantages and disadvantages of r and python
talk about what python is 
talk about basics
talk about tools that are used 
give an example
put code there as well 
maybe put a link to a different website with more information
